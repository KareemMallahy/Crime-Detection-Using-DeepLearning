# Crime-Detection-Using-DeepLearning
CCTV cameras are installed all around the world in each country and each city but still the crime rate is really increasing rapidly as we do 
not have the manpower to monitor the all the events and places, so we can implement an intelligent crime detection system using deep learning. 
We suggest utilizing both regular and abnormal videos to learn anomalies. We will be using a crime dataset which is called the UCF-crime dataset. 
This dataset consists of 128-hour video dataset that is the first of its type on a wide scale. It includes 1900 lengthy and uncut real-world 
surveillance footage, as well as 13 actual abnormalities such as fights, car accidents, burglaries, robberies, and other routine events. The goal of 
this project is to be able to detect the crime happening without involving any human in the process and raise an alarm to the police to fasten the 
process.
